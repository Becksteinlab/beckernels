# radical.ensemblemd kernels for the Beckstein Lab

These are custom kernels for use with `radical.ensemblemd` that make use of our own
builds of software such as gromacs on various resources. The package is
not really general-purpose, but is meant to be a shareable grab bag of execution
kernels for various MD tasks.
